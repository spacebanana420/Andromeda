## Introduction
The Andromeda Password Manager is a CLI password manager utility made for Linux and BSD-based systems

Andromeda uses AES for database encryption, stored in zip archives for flexibility. This utility is meant for a lighter and less serious use, it does not replace the complexity and security of commonly used password managers

Besides password management, a Lua script is also included and integrated with the main shell script to generate passwords based on either the ASCII table or a keyword dictionary

## How to use
Download Andromeda.sh and (optionally) passgen.lua and execute Andromeda.sh with bash
## Requirements
Bash, Lua (5.4 recommended), Zip and Unzip, GNU or Busybox coreutils
